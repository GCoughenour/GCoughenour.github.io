      <p>I started my career in coding as a computer science major at LCSC. However in order for a CS degree you also have to take some web development classes as well. After taking my first web development class and learning CSS and HTML I instantly fell in love with the program! Thus I switched my major and am now a sophomore in the Web Development and Design program. <br><br>
      
      I absolutely love making static websites as well as wordpress sites for businesses. (Work I have done can be found <a href = "works.html">here</a>). My skills do not just stop at web development, I also know other languages such as C#, and MySQL. </p>
